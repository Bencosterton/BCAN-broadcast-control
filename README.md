# BCAN Broadcast Control

BCAN Broadcast Control is a collection of resources used to control all aspects of a modern broadcast enviroment.

The ethos behind BCAN is to use open source control protocols to control your broadcast equiment, deleivered in a way that is also open source and easily configured without the need for proprietary coding languages or GIU interfaces.

BCAN is written entirly in python and Nodejs, meaning it can be picked up by the majority of engineers and used striaght out the box (no need for a trianing course), or can be easily understood with some basic python/JS learning.

BCAN Broadcast Control Client application also features a simple text edit interface, meaning it is a no-code solusion to existing control GUIs either hosted by the kit you own, or built by your engineering deptartment.
